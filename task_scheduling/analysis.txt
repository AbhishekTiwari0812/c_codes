Given algorithm is better than round robin because round robin doesn't assign any priority to a job.
It keeps on doing the tasks for a certain quatum of time which maybe not be a good idea for certain type of tasks.
It is clear that sometimes  user/machine wants to execute one task faster than other and it can suffer a delay for other types.
Round robin treats all tasks at equal priority.

The given algorithm is better than shortes remaining time first (SRTF) too.Because in case of SRTF  tasks which have very long turn around time get starved!
Whereas ,the given algorithm works in such a way that even the long tasks have good response time.
FCFS can not support multiprogramming paradigm..! For the next process to execute,the current process has to finish which leads to process starvation.
And response time will also be very big even for the small processes.

So, in comparison, most of the times, on parallel programming supported systems, the given algorithm would better than the other 3 (round robin ,SRTF and FCFS )
